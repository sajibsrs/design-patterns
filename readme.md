# # Modern PHP Design Patterns
(PHP version 8.0 or latest)

## # Intention
The intention is to simplify the ideas of different design patterns. The code examples are
overly simplified. These examples only focuses on what's important and additional operations kept to as minimal as possible. *It's more like proof of concept.*
