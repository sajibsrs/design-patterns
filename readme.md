# Design Patterns
The intention is to simplify the ideas of different design patterns. Focusing on what actually matters.

All code examples are overly simplified and uses same or similar concept to make it easy to understand and relate.

In some case there's **`Improvement`** section that describes how some certain pattern or it's usage can be improved with little effort.
